### More About Me
My name is Annette Balmes. I am 26 years old and have been interested in earth science as long as I can remember. I grew up on the front range of colorado and spent anytime in the car staring and dreaming of mountains, picturing how they could have been formed and feeling the immense power with every glance. As I still live along the edge of the Rocky Mountains, I am reminded every day about why I chose to follow my dream of learning about and understanding the earth. Once I discovered Geophysics, I was hooked. As I grow in my career, I still spend every day doing research, learning new things, and continuing to follow my dream. When I am not crocheting, creating stained glass, or playing my clarinet or singing in a choir, I spend my time outside paddle boarding, playing tennis, and hiking with my dog and husband. As a Colorado native, you grow up learning to spend your time outside, and I definitely have to lately as I work in a windowless office inside of the NOAA David Scaggs Building in Boulder.


### What I'm excited about learning about Earth Data Science
I am most excited to learn more about open science. As a research scientist working with magnetic data, I want to make sure that I am doing everything I can to adequetly share my science. Focusing on harnessing data to address pressing ecological challenges, deeply resonates with my academic and career aspirations.

### Questions that I'd like to answer using Earth Data Science
Using Earth Data Science, I hope to gain advanced skills in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting diverse magnetic datasets. This proficiency in data-driven decision-making will empower me to gain valuable insights from complex data. Learning how to apply cutting-edge tools and techniques to extract meaningful information will help with my goal.
