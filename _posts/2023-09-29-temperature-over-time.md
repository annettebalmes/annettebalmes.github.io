Weld County, CO monthly max and average temperatures from 2000 - 2007.

## Data Choice
I grew up in Weld County, Colorado and I have a memory of my mother never letting us use our pool unless it was over 85 degrees Fahrenheit. As I have gotten older, I was always curious as to her reason why, my assumption being that we would use the pool more infrequently. I want to investigate my hypothesis by looking at the temperature for the years we had a pool at our home. This will help me to get an initial glance at how likely the temperature throughout the year would be above 85Â° F.


## Data at a Glance
I lived in Greeley, CO which is in Weld County and I was able to pull data from the ncei website to get monthly values for the the monthly max temperature and avg temperatures from 2000 - 2007.
