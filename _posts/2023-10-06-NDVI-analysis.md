Using NDVI raster data to analyze vegetation regrowth after the Royal Gorge Fire that occured in 2013 just outside of Ca√±on City, CO.

## Data Choice
A popular attraction in the mountains of CO, west of Pueblo, is the Royal Gorge Canyon Train and Suspension Bridge. My family had a trip planned to back for this first time in a decade. The week before we went, a fire sparked and the park shut down, for 9 months. Even after that, everyone who went told us that it was sad to see the once lively park, covered in burn marks. It has now been another decade since the fire and when choosing a dataset to analyze, I was curious to see how long it took the landscape to recover. Below I analyze NDVI data to asses vegetation regrowth in the area where the fire occured. Watch the following video to see how the Royal Gorge park fared after 10 years.

## Data at a Glance

Royal Gorge Fire Quick Facts

 * First reported at 1pm June 11th, 2013.
 * 3,218 acres burned.
 * 32 out of 1,292 wooden planks burned on the Royal Gorge Bridge.
 * 48 out of 52 buildings in the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park were lost.
 * The Royal Gorge Bridge and Park was closed for 9 months. 
 * The Royal Gorge Fire was fully contained on June 16th, 2013.
 * No injuries were reported and no residential homes were lost.
 * Cost to rebuild park: $30 million
 * About 25,000 pounds of native grass and wildflower seeds were planted.

## Why NDVI for Vegetation Analysis
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs). Healthy vegetation (chlorophyll) reflects more near-infrared (NIR) and green light compared to other wavelengths. But it absorbs more red and blue light.

This is why our eyes see vegetation as the color green. If you could see near-infrared, then it would be strong for vegetation too.

## Data Analysis

To begin, I aquired the raster data from [Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Historic Perimeters 2013 API explorer site](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::historic-perimeters-2018/api) and downloaded it using the [APPEEARS](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/) API (Application Programming Interface) for the royal gorge location and looked at the NDVI.

First I looked at the NDVI difference for the immediate pre-fire and and post-fire years, 2012 to 2014.

We can see some areas with very clear differences in the NDVI spatially, in order to get a better idea as to where the edges of the fire were, I next plotted the boundary of the fire on top of the NDVI plot.

To get a better understanding of the values we are seeing, I also then created a histogram to see the spread of values.

Finally, to see how the area has fared over the last decade, I plotted for from before and after the fire, while taking a more in depth look at if the fire dropped more inside the boundary

# Results
When studying exact short-time frame events, using the instantaneous values gives us clues for that event. But in order to evaluate the trend for the full water year, using the mean values gives us that information.

Overall, I learned that the 2013 water year was not the overall worst year, but the event itself was the rarest event seen in this area since at least 1979.
