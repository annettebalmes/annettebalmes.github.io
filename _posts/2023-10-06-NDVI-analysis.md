Using NDVI raster data to analyze vegetation regrowth after the Royal Gorge Fire that occured in 2013 just outside of Ca√±on City, CO.

## Data Choice
A popular attraction in the mountains of CO, west of Pueblo, is the Royal Gorge Canyon Train and Suspension Bridge. My family had a trip planned to back for this first time in a decade. The week before we went, a fire sparked and the park shut down, for 9 months. Even after that, everyone who went told us that it was sad to see the once lively park, covered in burn marks. It has now been another decade since the fire and when choosing a dataset to analyze, I was curious to see how long it took the landscape to recover. Below I analyze NDVI data to asses vegetation regrowth in the area where the fire occured. Watch the following video to see how the Royal Gorge park fared after 10 years.

## Data at a Glance

Royal Gorge Fire Quick Facts

 * First reported at 1pm June 11th, 2013.
 * 3,218 acres burned.
 * 32 out of 1,292 wooden planks burned on the Royal Gorge Bridge.
 * 48 out of 52 buildings in the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park were lost.
 * The Royal Gorge Bridge and Park was closed for 9 months. 
 * The Royal Gorge Fire was fully contained on June 16th, 2013.
 * No injuries were reported and no residential homes were lost.
 * Cost to rebuild park: $30 million
 * About 25,000 pounds of native grass and wildflower seeds were planted.

## Why NDVI for Vegetation Analysis
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs). Healthy vegetation (chlorophyll) reflects more near-infrared (NIR) and green light compared to other wavelengths. But it absorbs more red and blue light.

This is why our eyes see vegetation as the color green. If you could see near-infrared, then it would be strong for vegetation too.

## Data Analysis

To begin, I aquired the raster data from [Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Historic Perimeters 2013 API explorer site](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::historic-perimeters-2018/api) and downloaded it using the [APPEEARS](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/) API (Application Programming Interface) for the royal gorge location and looked at the NDVI

Here is a closer look at the exact time range of the flood that occured in September, 2013 at the same gauge location. Note how many days it took for the stream to recover as well.

As the stream discharge values above are a mean, I also downloaded the annual instantaneous peak discharge values from [USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv?cb_00060=on&format=rdb&site_no=06741510&legacy=&referred_module=sw&period=&begin_date=1979-01-01&end_date=2023-10-02). Here is a look for the same time range using the instantaneous values.

In order to compare the difference between the mean daily and the annual peak instantaneous values, I annualized the daily data, and you can compare the difference below. Note how much smaller the values are from the mean vs. the peak.

As we analysis the likelihood of this flood happening again, clearly using the mean and instantaneous values will make a large difference. Going forward I will do calculations using both values to compare.

Instantaneous events are in purple, with the annually sampled mean in black, with a log scale along the y-axis for probability. We can see that the probability for the 2013 events are in star markers, and you can hover over them to see their exact values. Because of the mean usage, some years overall are much less likely to occur than the 2013 event as a hwole. So we see that the instantaneous values, show that the 2013 event was the least probable for all years in this location since 1979.

Finally, I also calculated the return period for the 2013 flood. We see a similar trend where the 2013 flood event itself has the highest return period. But 2013 as a whole was lower than other years when summed annually.

# Results
When studying exact short-time frame events, using the instantaneous values gives us clues for that event. But in order to evaluate the trend for the full water year, using the mean values gives us that information.

Overall, I learned that the 2013 water year was not the overall worst year, but the event itself was the rarest event seen in this area since at least 1979.
