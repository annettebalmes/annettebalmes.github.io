Looking at statistics and changes in time of wildfires that occur in HU2 and HU4 watershed regions in Colorado.

## Data Choice
As I discussed in my last project, forests are struggling to recover, especially in parts of Colorado.

There is another part to the devastation of wildfires as of late. Wildfires are changing with time, for the worse. Increases temporarlly and spatially are having system-altering effects throughout the U.S. Here are some articles if you would like to learn more.

* [The New York Times on increases in large wildfires in the Western US](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/27/climate/wildfire-global-warming.html)
* [Adapt to more wildfire in western North American forests as climate changes](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1617464114)

As I live in Colorado, I wanted to investigate how this is affecting my state. The graphic below is from the State of Colorado- Division of Fire Prevention & Control, Historical Wildfire Information section of their (website)[https://dfpc.colorado.gov/sections/wildfire-information-center/historical-wildfire-information]. We can see the same facts, fires are becoming more frequent and larger.

In terms of wildfire size, here is an example of the top 10 largest fires in Colorado in terms of acreage.

I wanted to look at time series of total numbers of fires and max fire sizes, specifically within Colorado. One way to do this is to take water regions that go through CO and copmare it to a database that contains wildfire information by watershed.

## Data at a Glance

Hydrologic Units (HU) and Watersheds

The United States is organized into a hierarchy of hydrologic units, which can be categorized into four distinct levels: regions, subregions, accounting units, and cataloging units. These hydrologic units are structured in a nested fashion, with larger geographic areas at the top (regions) and smaller geographic areas at the bottom (cataloging units). Each hydrologic unit is uniquely identified by a hydrologic unit code (HUC) comprising two to eight digits, corresponding to the four levels of the hydrologic unit system.

At the initial classification level, the country is partitioned into 21 major geographic regions. These regions encompass either the drainage basin of a major river, such as the Missouri region, or the collective drainage areas of multiple rivers, as exemplified by the Texas-Gulf region, which includes numerous rivers that flow into the Gulf of Mexico. Eighteen of these regions are situated within the contiguous United States, with Alaska representing region 19, the Hawaiian Islands constituting region 20, and Puerto Rico and other peripheral Caribbean areas forming region 21. [Please refer to Figure 1 for a visual depiction of these regions.]

Moving to the second classification level, the 21 regions are further divided into 221 subregions. Each subregion encompasses the land drained by a river system, a segment of a river and its associated tributaries, a closed basin or basins, or a cluster of streams that collectively form a coastal drainage area.

A great example comes from the (USGS NAS FaST - Flood and Storm Tracker Website)[https://nas.er.usgs.gov/hucs.aspx]. It shows each scaled of the different classification levels.

I will be analyzing at HUC-2 and HUC-4 levels and getting my data from the (Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD))[] website.

## Why NDVI for Vegetation Analysis
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs). Healthy vegetation (chlorophyll) reflects more near-infrared (NIR) and green light compared to other wavelengths. But it absorbs more red and blue light. This is why our eyes see vegetation as the color green. If you could see near-infrared, then it would be strong for vegetation too. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Written mathematically, the formula is:

NDVI = (NIR — VIS)/(NIR + VIS)

Calculations of NDVI for a given pixel always result in a number that ranges from minus one (-1) to plus one (+1); however, no green leaves gives a value close to zero. A zero means no vegetation and close to +1 (0.8 - 0.9) indicates the highest possible density of green leaves. 

## Data Analysis

To begin, I acquired the raster data from [Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Historic Perimeters 2013 API explorer site](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::historic-perimeters-2018/api) and downloaded it using the [APPEEARS](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/) API (Application Programming Interface) for the royal gorge location and looked at the NDVI.

First, I looked at the NDVI difference for the immediate pre-fire and post-fire years, 2012 to 2014.

    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"

</iframe>

We can see some areas with very clear differences in the NDVI spatially, in order to get a better idea as to where the edges of the fire were, I next plotted the boundary of the fire on top of the NDVI plot. Then I expanded the data to be from 2010 to 2023, so we can get a better picture of the full effects of the fire.

    width="710"
    height="500"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"

To get a better understanding of the values we are seeing, I also then created a histogram to see the spread of values, for the same parameters as the above plot.

    width="710"
    height="300"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>

In order to take into account if the fire dropped more inside the boundary than outside over the last decade, I plotted these values from 2010 - 2023 and show a vertical line where the fire occurred on the plot below as well. Despite 25,000 pounds of planting wildflowers and grasses being planted in the area, the area has barely seen any vegetation recovery inside the fire boundary.

    width="710"
    height="300"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>

Finally, I wanted to look at the NDVI values for different years, instead of looking at the difference. We can see below that the upper right part of the fire has had the most vegetation regrowth, but still does not look like it did before the fire. And the lower left portion of the fire originally had less vegetation overall than the upper right area, but the vegetation has barely begun to become healthier/more abundant.

<iframe src="/assets/ndvi/ndvi_values_2012_2013_2023.html"

    width="810"
    height="950"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">

And their respective histograms which makes sense. In 2013, the values shifted lower as it was the year of the fire, and in present day, the values have shifted higher overall, but still are not similar to the year before the fire, 2012.

# Results
It will take decades for the trees and vegetation to ever recover following the royal gorge fire. A research team from Australian National University found that forests’ ability to recover from a fire can stretching to more than 80 years. This means that we may continue to see devastated landscapes post-fire for many years to come, impacting the ability for wildlife to reemerge and humans to recreate in these areas. 

A University of Colorado Boulder study noted that in the Southern Rocky Mountains the post-fire landscape is becoming unsuitable for future growth of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. This finding from their research reveals that if fires continue to drastically harm the soil quality and ecosystem health, it may be hard for local trees to regrow in those areas.

Someday I hope to revisit the area, and hopefully in my lifetime it will look just like it did when I was a kid.
